## Summary
Based on the analysis it appears that male corporate workers were predominantly the main users of the bike service, and that the subscription service is popular among those users. 2 additional things to look at would be what the purpose of each bike ride is (transportation, leisure, exercise, etc.) and more info about spefically where riders are going (work, popular bars, restaurants, etc.)
